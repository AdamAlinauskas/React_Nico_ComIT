# Learning React.js

## What's React.js

> React.js is a a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (Official site Definition)

### Declarative

> React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. 
Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

### Component-Based
> Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

### Learn Once, Write Anywhere
> We don’t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.
React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native).

❤️ [React.js official documentation](https://reactjs.org) is great so we'll try to use it as mutch as possible to learn about this great JavaScript library

Try doing all the exercises your self but if you get stuck then you can check the [exercises code](examples/exercises)

## How to add React.js to a Website

As React.js is a JavaScript library we can add it to our existing HTML, CSS & JavaScript site. We can use React.js to create a single component inside our site or build a complete SPA.

[Single Page Applicatio (SPA) - blog post](https://www.academind.com/learn/web-dev/dynamic-vs-static-vs-spa)

[Single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)

In order to use React.js first we need to be able to add it to our current site. You can learn how to do it by reading and following the [Add React.js to a website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html)

Try the following exercises but don't worry if you don't get everything at this moment. Focus on getting them to work first, you'll understand more after you finish this guide.
